page</a> ]<br><h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>MessAdmin
is a utility for viewing and interacting with Java HttpSession.
MessAdmin can be added to any J2EE application, with zero change to the
monitored application!<br>With MessAdmin, you can:<br><ul><li>display
statistics about a Web Application</li><li>monitor
every active HttpSession in a web application</li><li>see
detailed information about any session</li><li>remove any
attribute from any session</li><li>manually expire any
session</li><li>send a html message to any user of the
application, or all of them</li></ul>MessAdmin
can be added to any J2EE application. And apart from a very minor
change to your web.xml, you don't need to change anything at all in
your web application! That's right, no coding, no application change!<br>Administration
is done either with a built-in servlet, or via JMX (if available).<br><small><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small><br><h2><a name="features">Full feature list</a></h2>See
and interact with MessAdmin via<br><ul><li>built-in
administration servlet</li><li>JMX (if available)</li></ul>WebApp-related
statistics and operations:<br><ul><li>number of
active Sessions</li><li>number of passive Sessions</li><li>maximum
number of concurrent
Sessions (peak), with date at which this event happened</li><li>total
number of created Sessions</li><li>total number of hits</li><li>total
Request size (incoming bandwidth)</li><li>total Response
size
(outgoing bandwidth)</li><li>list of ServletContext
(application-scope) attributes, with size and remove operation</li></ul>Session-related
statistics and operations:<br><ul><li>remote user name</li><li>remote
user locale</li><li>remote host IP</li><li>last
Request URL</li><li>isSecure flag (e.g.
https)</li><li>date created</li><li>date of
last access</li><li>TTL (time to live before expiration)</li><li>total
number of hits</li><li>total Request size</li><li>total
Response size</li><li>last Request size and date</li><li>last
Response size and date</li><li>list of HttpSession
attributes,
with size and remove operation</li><li>send an HTML message
to all
or any user of the application</li><li>invalidate any HttpSession</li></ul>As
a bonus, MessAdmin takes care of some evil singleton cleanup at
application shutdown, thereby avoiding some dreadful OOM
(java.lang.OutOfMemoryError) on hot restart:<br><ul><li>JDBC drivers: java.sql.DriverManager - Evil Singleton (drivers should be located at application-server level)</li><li>java.beans.Introspector - Slightly less Evil singleton</li><li>Jakarta Commons Logging &lt;= 1.0.4</li></ul>You will still have to take care of your own ThreadLocals; there's nothing I can do for you there...<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>MessAdmin
needs at least Java 1.3, and a
Java Servlet/JSP container (Servlet
2.3/J2EE 1.3). JMX administration requires Java 5.<br><small><a href="#toc">back

first take the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="ss_list.html">session
list view</a>.
There you can sort the information by clicking on the column headers
(don't forget this is a screenshot; it won't work here!), manually
expire some sessions and send messages.<br>Before doing any of that, Have
a look at session <a href="ss_detail.html" target="_blank">0920E225E358F91C0F990BC8533471A0</a>.
You have a summary of interesting data for this session (including the
remote IP in case you need to physically locate the user) as well as
every attributes in the session (which you can remove).<br>Now let's come
back to the previous screen and send a message to this user. Notice how
you can use HTML. Once sent, notice the little 'M' in the <a target="_blank" href="ss_list2.html">resulting list</a>.
On his next action, the user will get a <a target="_blank" href="popup.gif">popup</a> with your message.<br>Finally, let's finish with some statistics on the <a target="_blank" href="ss_webapp.html">web application</a> itself.<br><small><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small><br><h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>Please
refer to the documentation (INSTALL.txt) in the package for detailed
instructions. You can find the download at the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=147751">SourceForge
project page</a>.<br>You will have to:<br><ul><li>copy
MessAdmin.jar&nbsp;in your WEB-INF/lib/ directory</li><li>copy
the MessAdmin folder (containing the administration pages) into your
document root directory</li><li>copy some configuration to
your web.xml</li></ul>That's all! You do not need to modify
the source code of your application. This is powerful stuff!<br>Some
of the installation options can be customized. Please see the doc.<br><small><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small><br><h2><a name="FAQ">FAQ</a></h2><h3>License /

How much memory/CPU does it use?</h3>MessAdmin
is already used in production sites. Its overhead is very small (less
than 600 bytes per session) and doesn't make any heavy computation.
With
its plug'n'play capabilities, there is no reason&nbsp;to not add it
to all
your applications.<br><h3>What's in stock for the future?</h3>While
MessAdmin has now reached a reasonably stable phase, we do have a stock
of features we will eventually add over the time. Refer to the TODO.txt
